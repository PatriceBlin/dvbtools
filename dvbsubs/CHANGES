Version 0.2

dvbtextsubs - Added "lang" attribute to spu tags (based on the 
              teletext code page).
            - Added support for parsing ".vdr" streams containing subtitles 
              recorded using the ttxtsubs plugin. Thanks to Ragnar Sundblad.
            - Various improvements to the parsing of the teletext stream
            - Completed the mapping for the Swedish/Finnish/Hungarian (code 
              page 3) characters to iso-8859-1.
            - Use audio PTS for subtitles when the teletext PES packets do not
              include a PTS (only implemented for -vdr format - not TS format).
            - Fixed a bug in the PTS decoding.  Thanks to Ragnar Sundblad.

xml2spumux - Correctly parse UTF-8 text provided by libxml2 into
             iso-8859-1 and map to character encoding used by my teletext 
             font - i.e. fix handling of characters with accents.

Version 0.1 - Initial release.
