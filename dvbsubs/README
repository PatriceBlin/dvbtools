dvbsubs - version 0.3 (formally dvbtextsubs)
--------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

dvbsubs is a package for decoding teletext subtitles and DVB
subtitles from a DVB broadcast and converting them (via an
intermediate XML file in the case of teletext subtitles) into PNG
files suitable for use in authoring a DVD using dvdauthor.

There are three programs in this package:

* dvbtextsubs - decode DVB teletext subtitles (text-based subtitles)
* dvbsubs - decode DVB subtitles (bitmapped subtitles)
* xml2spumux - create PNG files from the subtitles produced by dvbtextsubs

1. INSTALLATION
---------------

dvbtextsubs requires "libpng" (for writing PNG files) and "libxml2"
(for parsing the XML file).  

Compile the applications by simply typing "make".

2. USAGE
--------

In order to extract subtitles from a recorded transport stream
(e.g. recorded by dvbstream):

dvbtextsubs pid pageno < recording.ts > subtitles.xml

or from a set of ".vdr" files recorded using VDR:

cat 0*.vdr | dvbtextsubs -vdr pageno > subtitles.xml

The "pid" is probably the same as the teletext PID for the channel.
However, on some channels, the subtitles are broadcast on a different
PID to normal teletext.

The "pageno" is the teletext page containing the subtitles.  This
varies by country (and broadcaster), common choices are 888, 777 or
699 but it can be any page

You can then generate a set of PNG files from this XML file by using
the "xml2spumux" program:

xml2spumux subtitles.xml > spumux.xml

This program prints a subtitle XML file to stdout for use by spumux
(part of dvdauthor - see http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net) and creates
a set of PNG files, one for each subtitle.

Using spumux, you can then add these subtitles to your already "DVD
format" audio/video file as follows:

spumux spumux.xml < recording.mpg > subtitled.mpg

For example, a broadcast on BBC1 (vpid=2304, apid=2306, text pid=2305)
on the Astra 2D satellite at 28 degrees east could be authored as a
DVD with the following set of commands.

# dvbstream -n 1800 -f 10773 -p h -s 22000 -o 2304 2305 2306 > recording.ts

(this creates a recording 1800 seconds long = 30 minutes)

# mplex -i TS_STREAM -t DVD -o recording.mpg -p 2306 -q 2304 recording.ts

(this is the mplex included as part of dvb-mpegtools.  Other suitable
multiplexers include the mjpegtools mplex (use mplex -f 8), tcmplex
and replex.

# dvbtextsubs 2305 888 < recording.ts > subtitles.xml
# xml2spumux subtitles.xml > spumux.xml
# spumux spumux.xml < recording.mpg > subtitled.mpg
# dvdauthor -o DVD -s en -a en recording.mpg
# dvdauthor -o DVD -T

You should now have a DVD structure in the "DVD" subdirectory.  You
can play it using "ogle" or "xine":

ogle ./DVD/
xine /full/path/to/DVD/

or burn it to DVD using growisofs:

growisofs -Z /dev/scd0 -dvd-video DVD

There are many more possibilities for DVD authoring (chapters, menus
etc) using dvdauthor - see http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net for more
details.

Where possible, you should use the latest versions (which may mean CVS
versions) of all the above tools.


3. NOTES 
--------

1) On a DVD, the palette (i.e. colour) information for subtitles
is stored in the ".IFO" files, and not the ".VOB" files.  Therefore,
if you attempt to play "subtitled.mpg" before authoring the DVD, then
the colours will be incorrect.

spumux cunningly hides the palette information inside "subtitled.mpg".
This is then read by dvdauthor and the information moved to the IFO
files during the dvd authoring process.

2) DVD subpictures are limited to 4 colours.  My subtitles use one
colour for the transparent background and one for the black
background.  This leaves 2 foreground colours for use by the
subtitles.  Depending on the broadcaster, this may cause you problems.
If this happens, spumux will ignore that PNG file.  The current
solution is to manually edit the subtitles.xml file to reduce the
number of colours.  Later versions of dvbtextsubs will help with this.
It is also possible that future versions of spumux can use a
little-documented feature of DVDs in order to increase the number of
colours.

3) DVD subpictures are 720x576 pixels for PAL and 720x480 for NTSC.
xml2spumux only generates PAL sized pictures - as teletext is mainly a
European system.  Contact me if you would like support for 720x480
images.

4) If the input to dvbtextsubs contains "gaps in time" (e.g. commercials
have been removed), then this will result in incorrect timestamps
assigned to the subtitles after this cut (they will follow the uncut
timings).

-----------------------------

dvbtextsubs was written by Dave Chapman <dave@dchapman.com>.  The
latest version is available from http://www.linuxstb.org/dvbtextsubs/.
It is loosely based on my own dvbtext application and takes the DVB
tuning code from my dvbtune/dvbstream applications.

The Teletext font was taken from the file vtx20x24.gif included with
JVtxView 0.0.1 - http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~mdenn

Thanks to Ragnar Sundblad for his help in adding support for parsing
teletext subtitles stored in VDR recordings using his ttxtsubs plugin.
This plugin is available from ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/home/ragge/vdr/
