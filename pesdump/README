pesdump - version 0.1
---------------------

pesdump is a utility for use with the Siemens DVB driver (available
at http://www.linuxtv.org).

Usage
-----

1) Tune your DVB card to a channel - e.g. using dvbtune
 
2) Run pesdump with a PID as the only parameter

e.g.

pesdump 643 > recording.pes

to record the stream identified by PID 643.

You can run multiple instances at the same time to record different
PES streams from the same transponder.

If the PES stream is an audio stream, then you can convert it to a
format that, for example mpg123, will play using the pes2aud_es
utility supplied with the DVB driver (in DVB/apps/mpegtools/).
