DVBimage-0.1
------------

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

This program will only work with the "standard" DVB driver from
linuxtv.org.  It won't work with versions of the driver that have the
"Still Image Patch" applied (for use with VDR).


INTRODUCTION
------------

DVBimage is a program to display still images on a DVB card.  It is
designed to be used as an Internet webcam viewer.

The latest version can be found at http://www.linuxstb.org/dvbimage/

USAGE
-----

dvbimage ./script.sh

Where script.sh is a script (or any other executable) that creates a
file called /tmp/dvbimage.mpg containing a single MPEG-2 I-Frame image
of size 702x576 pixels.

An example script is as follows:

-- start of script --
#!/bin/sh
curl -s http://www.webviews.co.uk/liveimages/latino01.jpg > /tmp/latino1.jpg
convert -sample 702x576\! /tmp/latino1.jpg /tmp/dvbimage.mpg
-- end of script --

More examples are in the "scripts" subdirectory.

This script is called every 10 seconds by the dvbimage program, and
the resulting image displayed on the DVB card.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

The example scripts use the "curl" program to fetch a URL from the
Internet.  This can be downloaded from:

http://curl.sourceforge.net/

You may (of course) substitute curl with one of the many other
programs (lynx -source, wget etc) that do the same job.

You also need the "imagemagick" set of utilities which are used to
convert the image (in nearly any format) to the required MPEG-2
I-Frame format.

Imagemagick needs the "mpeg2encoder" program to be in the current path
in order to generate MPEG-2 I-Frames.  This can be downloaded from:

http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/MSSG/#source
