rtptsaudio v0.2 - Dave Chapman <dave@dchapman.com>
--------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

rtptsaudio is a audio client for RTP-multicast MPEG-2 Transport
Streams.  

REQUIREMENTS

rtptsaudio requires at least version 0.14.2b of libmad - a GPL'd mpeg
audio decoder library.  It is available from:

http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/

To install the library, use the following commands:

./configure --enable-shared
make
su
[Enter root password]
make install

You will also need access to a RTP-multicast "MPEG-2 Transport Stream".
e.g. using dvbstream from http://www.linuxstb.org/dvbstream/

INSTALLATION

You can modify the IP address and port of the stream you want to
receive in rtptsaudio.c

Then type "make" to compile.  

USAGE

rtptsaudio [-ao audiotype] [-o filename] [-t secs] PID

Options: -ao oss    Linux Open Sound System output (default)
             mpa    Unprocessed MPEG Audio stream to stdout
             raw    Raw PCM data (16 bit Little-Endian Stereo) to stdout
         -o  file   Output filename or audio device (default=stdout)
         -t  secs   Number of seconds to receive before quitting

where PID is the PID of the audio stream you wish to play.  This can
either be a radio station, or the audio stream of a TV station.  Only
MPEG audio streams are supported (i.e. not AC3 as used by some TV
broadcasters).

You can run multiple instances of rtptsaudio on the same machine at
the same time.  For example, if you wanted to play PID 643, and also
record the unprocessed MPEG audio stream to a file, type the following
two commands (in different terminals):

rtptsaudio 643
rtptsaudio -ao mpa -o recording.mp2 643

If your CPU is fast enough, you can re-encode in real-time into MP3.
For example, to use lame (www.mp3dev.org) to create a 128kbps MP3
file, use the following command:

rtptsaudio -ao mpa 643 | lame --mp2input - recording.mp3

I have tested this using LAME version 3.91 and the process uses about
20% of my 1GHz Pentium III CPU.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

rtptsaudio uses a lot of code from the "mpegtools" package distributed
with the linuxtv.org DVB driver.  This code is (C) 2000, 2001 Marcus
Metzler for Convergence Integrated Media Gmbh and released under the
GNU GPL.

rtp.c is a slightly modified version of the sendrtp_ts.c file included
with the "ts-rtp" package (also from linuxtv.org).  It was writen by
David Podeur for Convergence Integrated Media Gmbh and released under
the GNU GPL.

The code to use libmad is based heavily on the "madlld" tutorial
application written by Bertrand Petit.  It is available at
http://www.bsd-dk.dk/~elrond/audio/madlld/
